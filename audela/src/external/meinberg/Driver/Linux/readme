The "IRQF_DISABLED" symbol has been provided by the kernel sources, but
has been obsoleted some time ago and has been removed from the kernel
source in kernel 4.1, so the driver package doesn't compile on kernel
4.1 or later.

I'm actually working on putting an updated driver package together, but
this will still take some time.

In the mean time, you can download this package:

https://www.meinberg.de/download/drivers/mbgtools-lx-dev-2014-12-02.tar.gz

After you have unpacked the archive you can also download this one:

https://www.meinberg.de/download/drivers/mbgtools-lx-dev-2014-12-02-mbgclock_main.c.tar.gz

This contains a single file mbgclock_main.c which you can copy over the
existing file in the mbgclock/ subdirectory of the driver source.

Then just run "make" in the base directory to build the new driver, just
like you've done before.

This should work also with the latest kernels. If you encounter any
problems, please contact me.


Regards,

Martin
