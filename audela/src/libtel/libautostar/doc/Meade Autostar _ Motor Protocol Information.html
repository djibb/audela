<h2>Title:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Autostar / Motor
protocol description</h2>
<h2>Version:&nbsp;&nbsp; 2</h2>
<h2>Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17 Aug 2005<br>
</h2>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
This document describes the protocol used between the autostar (#494
,#497) controllers and the RA and DEC motors.<br>
<br>
This document doesn't cover the protocol used between the Autostar and
devices that plug into the accessory socket as I don't have any of
these accessories.<br>
<br>
This document is not complete (there are some commands whose purpose I
haven't discovered), but it should be sufficiently complete for many
purposes.<br>
<h2>Notices:</h2>
The information in this document is derived from US patent #6,304,376
(held by Meade), and observation of the interactions between the
Autostar controllers and the DH series motors.<br>
<br>
The information in this document was not derived via disassembly of the
Autostar or motor processor firmware.<br>
<br>
Care must be taken to not violate the claims of the aforementioned
patent in applying this information. <br>
<br>
Any consequences of the use of this information is the sole
responsibility of the user.<br>
<h2>Interface signals:</h2>
Each motor is connected to the autostar using two signals (plus a
common ground). These clock and data signals allow the implementation
of a bidirectional serial protocol.<br>
<br>
The clock signal for each motor is always driven by the Autostar, which
determines the transfer timing. The frequency of the clock signal is
Autostar dependent with a frequency of around 5.5 kHz.<br>
<br>
The data signal is driven either the Autostar or the motor and appears
to only be driven low. The signal is weakly pulled high by the Autostar.<br>
<br>
Although the wiring between the Autostar and the motors would allow the
two sets of signals to be completely seperated, it appears that the
data lines are either tied together in the Autostar controllers.<br>
<br>
The DH motors appear to reset if the clock line is held low for more
than a few ms. I'm not sure what the magic time is.<br>
<h2>Data transfer protocol:</h2>
The data transfer is in structured as a series of commands. Each
command has:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>A start sequence (which allows the Autostar to be sure there is a
motor present)</li>
  <li>A command sequence during which the eight bit command is sent by
the Autostar</li>
  <li>A data sequence during which some number of bits containing data
associated with the command, or returned by the Autostar. The number of
bits is a function of the command, but is always constant for a given
command</li>
</ul>
Each bit of data after the start sequence is transferred as follows:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The Autostar drives the clock line high</li>
  <li>The transmitter of the bit forces the data line low (to transfer
a zero value), or allows it to float high</li>
  <li>The Autostar drives the clock line low</li>
  <li>The receiver of the bit samples the data line to determine the
bit value</li>
</ul>
<h3>Start sequence:</h3>
In response to the Autostar driving the clock line low, the motor
drives the data line low. This is used by the #494 Autostar to
determine the presence of a motor.<br>
<br>
The state of the data line seems to be ignored by the #497 Autostar
software.<br>
<br>
<h3>Command sequence:</h3>
An eight bit command. MSB first, is sent by the Autostar. This tells
the motor what to do and what bits will be transferred later in the
transfer.<br>
<br>
<h3>Data sequence:</h3>
The most significant bit of the most significant byte (for multibye
data) is transferred first. Some commands use a number of bits
which is not a multiple of eight.<br>
<br>
I know of the following commands. I've had to guess at the
interpretation of some of them, and there are a few I don't know yet.
Ignoring them when emulating the motor seems to work without obvious
problems.<br>

The following example commands sequeces may help understand the
interaction of the autostar and motors. Note that these are the #494
sequences, but they seem to be the same as the #497 ones. (Values
returned by status command often differ due to differences in motor
speed and command timing)<br>
<br>
Startup:<br>
<br>
0x5<br>
0x8 (ret: 0x0 0x0 0x0 0)<br>
0xb (ret 0x10)<br>
0x3 0xe7<br>
<br>
Initial alignment:<br>
<br>
0x5<br>
0x8 (ret: 0x0 0x0 0x0 0)<br>
0x7<br>
0x8 (ret 0x0 0x2a 0xff 0) [repeated many times during slew]<br>
0x0 0x47 0x1c 0x6f [near end of slew]<br>
<br>
Sleep scope:<br>
<br>
0x5<br>
0xe4<br>
<br>
Park scope:<br>
0x0 0xff 0xa1 0x57<br>
0x8 (ret: 0xff 0xff 0x0 0)<br>
0x5<br>
<br>
Calibrate motors:<br>
0x5<br>
0xe4<br>
(motors move at this point. I assume it's due to a low-clock reset.
This lasts 1 - 2 seconds)<br>
0x5<br>
0x4<br>
0x9 (ret: 0xe7)<br>
0x8 (ret: 0x8 0x25 0x6c 0x0 0)<br>
<br>
Not sure about the timing of this set of commands, but each phase seems
to be less that 5 seconds.<br>
